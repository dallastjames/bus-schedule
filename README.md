# BusSchedule

This application has been upgraded to the latest Angular (Angular 8 at the current time)
in addition to upgrading the other core libraries. NGXS has been added to provide
a reactive state management library. In addition to these upgrades, other cosmetic
changes have been made to improve the overall performance of the app and to better
follow the [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) recommendations.
